Absolutely no. Something MUST give <This message was edited>
21/11/2024, 10:21 - +254 708 849873: Please never downplay your work..it starts small and builds up with more exposure ad practice.

 Throw in these ideas here for those that have no idea that's concrete, or are sceptical it will work. 
I believe this group exists to help with this particularly
21/11/2024, 10:21 - +254 740 529926: We are never the same. Once you start comparing yourself you will not see your idea as a solution to a problem you pointed out
21/11/2024, 10:23 - +254 740 529926: Yes. 
Personally am a PR Manager and have my own startup which is a digital media and Communications agency and am not even burned with the great ideas here because i know what my company offers. Its my idea, my concept. The group is a boost for us to even learn and grow.

21/11/2024, 10:30 - +254 708 849873: Personally, I think this mentality is why they survive. If he were like China or Singapore who didn't allow bribery with severe consequences ie execution of corrupt people plus their families, we would be much further 

We the people set the attitude of what we allow in society, and giving up before trying to set any standard guarantees failure ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

As someone who is trying to grow in a service industry, it's been difficult coming up with ideas that I thought "make sense" 

If you start something because others are doing it, it won't work out.
As long as you believe in your abilities and offering then use that to offer solutions in your field.
21/11/2024, 11:07 - +254 740 357254: I love this now go and apply for Athena Executive Assistant, I hope you get the job, but if you don't I will be behind the tent you can join me in shedding premium tears. But a good mindset is just as good as results, to be honest in this day and age it is very easy to give up because nothing is working. But shedding a few premium tears behind the tent helps a lot actually. You will feel like  a new man/lady and ready to tackle another day of rejections

21/11/2024, 11:14 - +254 708 849873: There really is a power in giving in but not giving up..knowing the difference makes all the difference 

By giving in, you release your mind to explore the possibilities your rigidity had refused your mind to explore 

But Mimi nayo Athena apana. I want to hear only ONE success story ndio niamini coz paying a full time VA KES 70,000 nayo is stealing from them. 
Even if I was to charge $5 an hour as my starting rate, that's KES 104,000 I should be paid. Where's the 34,000/- going? Na saa hizo Zakayo hajakuja kuninyandua 42% of that 70,000/-

There's something Athena isn't saying, I have very many questions mimi <This message was edited>
21/11/2024, 11:14 - +254 790 050102: About *Athena*

üåü *We are here* since we want to create businesses, not to work for toxic agencies and employers. 
_*I didn't mention anyone.*_ 

üåü *We are here* to create opportunities, create positive working environments for others. Pay them well so that they can grow as well. 

üåü It's not bad to look for freelancing gigs, but be careful with where you are looking. 

Look for a place where you will grow. 

*Athena* are in Kenya just to source for *free* and *cheap labor.* They don't care about you, they only care about their clients. 

*Ask around* how many people have interviewed with Athena before you even start the process. 

*Ask around,* those people who got in after the 1 million interviews and intense trainings and were dropped off like hot charcoal just because the client didn't like the *Africanism* in them

Whatever you do with this information is upto you.

Good day .

I want to hear even one success story niamini. Success being getting the job and being in their system for more than 3months consecutively, paid on time, no hitilafu. Wao kuja Piano means nothing if you ask me.  That was a presentation, pure and simple. We want the proof of concept 

 If you've seen people like One Acre Fund or how the UN operate, you'd understand my scepticism

And I asked the same question, then she was like "ooh the interviews are very competitive, we only pick 1% bla bla bla"

At the time I was in a group of over 100 qualified and overqualified VAs in Kenya only. 

I tell her that and 90% of these VAs had applied and failed. some on the application stage others on the interview stage others immediately after they were matched with clients they got fired. 

Do you know that she did not respond, she was like "Give me your name" I knew it was a bluff just to dismiss me. 

And that's the reality, they *Do not Care*
21/11/2024, 11:27 - +254 740 357254: I hope this is not Athena rebranded????...

Then My statement >>> _Everyone has their path and value is relative...._

My whole perspective is kila mtu ako on a specific path to apply or not to is her choice and what she is doing - ~Everyone has their path~ , enlightening us on current issues '_Adani_' is also valuable maybe this is just not the right  platform to address - ~value is relative~

I hope this helps. <This message was edited>

They prefer having people from within Nairobi. Reasons best known to them in as much as they're calling it remote job.

They call you for physical interviews as well.

For training you have both remote and onsite.

22/11/2024, 13:47 - +254 708 849873: Least favorite was PMI, Google & KPMG for some reason..loved NTT Data, the serial entrepreneur Sam's session, Flutterwave, Cisco and the CV writing one most especially. Missed out on the intros but the recordings are up so yaay!
I'll share the learnings from the CV writing one, hopefully by end of today . Had many amazing nuggets
22/11/2024, 13:48 - +254 111 711713: This was amazingüëè
22/11/2024, 13:48 - +254 708 849873: Iko hapo juu tu when you open the app using the link you were sent by ALX
22/11/2024, 13:50 - +254 708 849873: I think I prefer the ALX presenters on this more, Joan Thuo particularly hosts better sessions if you ask me. Huyu sounded like those old toxic HRs (I have worked with KPMG before and fyew! Pray you find the good ones if you intern there)
Her presentation looked very unprofessional for a person of her stature in my mind
22/11/2024, 13:50 - +254 708 849873: I've highlighted the steps..let me know which is tripping you up
22/11/2024, 13:51 - +254 707 172286: NTT was really amazing too
22/11/2024, 13:52 - +254 707 172286: And Bradley Opere
22/11/2024, 13:52 - +254 708 849873: Right? That's a power team right there

01/12/2024, 14:25 - +254 790 976155: When they share the link please let me know
01/12/2024, 14:56 - +254 703 161180: Is there a skill that pays more than entrepreneurship?
01/12/2024, 14:58 - +254 741 532447: This is debatable üòÇ some skills do pay more
01/12/2024, 14:59 - +254 728 899184: None but remember entrepreneurship includes selling of products and services
01/12/2024, 14:59 - +254 728 899184: Isn't services a skill?
01/12/2024, 15:00 - +254 728 899184: Now learn a high paying skill,sell it.
01/12/2024, 15:00 - +254 741 532447: Precisely, entrepreneurship is a combination of several skills, including communication, leadership etc
01/12/2024, 15:02 - +254 703 161180: For example?
01/12/2024, 15:05 - +254 728 899184: Yes,say you do graphic design,you need to know how to communicate, imagine knowing how to communicate but you don't have a skill.....
01/12/2024, 15:06 - +254 703 161180: On point
01/12/2024, 15:16 - +254 728 899184: Cyber security and data engineering
01/12/2024, 15:20 - +254 703 161180: Cybersecurity, AI, Data, and Software Engineers are high-earning professionals, employed and paid by entrepreneurs for their valuable skills. Right?
01/12/2024, 15:53 - +254 741 532447: Very true, but then entrepreneurs cannot survive without them, which makes them more valuable.  Remember these professionals, especially in the tech sector can work independently but they need each other.
01/12/2024, 15:56 - +254 728 899184: Very true ü§£
01/12/2024, 15:56 - +254 728 899184: But don't shout
01/12/2024, 15:58 - .: I think it's also important to be a technical founder that way you will not have to relie on people to with the skills to progress as in the early stages there is little to offer in terms of funds
01/12/2024, 15:59 - +254 703 161180: On point. It's a structural functionalist system. We need each other to run the society and the economy. From Engineers, Doctors, Teachers, Psychologists, Entrepreneurs, Drivers, Boda boda riders etc. The most important thing should be diligence in whatever path you take. Be a diligent Database architect, Graphics designer, Journalist, Mama mboga etc.
01/12/2024, 16:02 - +254 703 161180: Hhah. Entrepreneurship can kill you more easily than it can give you the amounts of money Technical, on demand but scarce professionals like Data,  AI/ML Engineers earnüòÄ.
01/12/2024, 16:04 - +254 728 899184: Browse on linkedin, check out the job applications,these fields are becoming over crowded already
01/12/2024, 16:05 - +254 728 899184: Current world requires you to learn a skill within 6 months,sell it earn money then learn another one chap chap ukisonga
01/12/2024, 16:07 - +254 728 899184: e.g Machine learning, before we even understood it we now have MLOPS which is even more profitable
01/12/2024, 16:09 - +254 703 161180: Makes sense. A lot. 
I've been there in the recent past. I, however, made peace with the fact that I'll have to break the bank since I can't learn all the Languages and frameworks I need for my project at the moment.
Nonetheless, I'm learning at my own pace now. I wish someone told me not to stop at HTML, CSS & basic JS a few years ago when I did the 3. <This message was edited>
01/12/2024, 16:09 - +254 728 899184: True
01/12/2024, 16:11 - +254 741 532447: These will be only helpful when creating a landing page üòÇ but an entire system requires much more than that

This is more of a freelancer mentality üòÄ.

You are intentionally misleading us, Engineer üòÄ.

I value and highly honor mastery. If you go for mastery, get to the 90th percentile in your niche, you'll forever be in demand; hardly replaceable. I think.

01/12/2024, 16:14 - +254 741 532447: I am also facing a similar problem where I need higher skills to implement an AI powered tool, and I am currently a backend engineerüòÇüòÇ
01/12/2024, 16:53 - +254 708 849873: I assumed as much since it was shared in an ALX forum.
